BrowserHistory WODs was a new way of testing my programming knowledge that I have never seen before and I really enjoyed these assignments.  I have a little experience with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Java, so I have a basic understanding of a few fundamentals and concepts in these languages.  However, trying to complete these assignments under a specific time is what made these assignments the most challenging for me.  Throughout our career, time is an important factor when it comes to completing projects by a specific deadline.  In addition to time constraints, we must have adequate knowledge and accuracy to complete these projects.  In spite of that, there are a few problems and solutions within each WOD that I encountered, and a few things that I have learned about the Athletic Approach.

**BrowserHistory1**

In BrowserHistory1, the task was not too bad to complete because I was able to complete the assignment in 13 minutes on the first try.  I have practiced setting up basic webpages from previous classes I have taken, and I think formatting and commonly used HTML tags such as `<h1>`, `<img src>`, `<p>`, `<li>`, along with a few other tags is what I am most comfortable with as of now.  One part that I had trouble with for a few minutes was figuring out how to set the size of an image while inside an HTML document.  I know that you can place CSS in HTML by using `<style>`, but I had no clue that you could do something as simple as defining `width=100` within the same tag as the `<img src>`; because I normally link an external stylesheet and do all the CSS on there.  Aside from this, everything else was not too bad to complete.  After completing the assignment and watching the screencast, one thing I noticed I did different even though I got the same outcome was the attributes used to link the table of contents list to each of the four internal sections of the page.  I used `ID` for my linking, and Professor Port used `name` for his linking.  I have never used “name” before to do something like this, so I ended up doing research for the difference between these two and gained a better understanding of when to apply each attribute.  I resorted to my two most favorite websites, the Mozilla Developer Network and W3 Schools, which are fantastic resources to learn HTML/CSS in my opinion!  This is something else that I like about WODs because even if you think you know something, you will learn that there might be an easier or more efficient way to do something than what you are used to doing.  Sometimes you might get stuck on something you might not know how to do and it is okay because many developers in the workforce don’t know every single thing about coding because it’s a lifelong learning process.  Another thing that I did differently was adding an alternative text for the images.  Alternative text for images is used wherein the case of an image not loading, an alternative text is shown saying what the image should be.  One thing that took a couple of minutes to figure out was how to download the chrome image.  For some reason, I could not right-click to download the image and had to use a png converter to convert the SVG image.

**BrowserHistory2**

Although I was able to finish BrowserHistory2 in around 11 minutes, this workout was a little more challenging than the first one because of the vast amount of CSS properties that can be used to style an HTML page.  The only thing that stumped me in CSS was making the logos inline with the text.  When I got to this part, I had no clue what CSS property to use, so I ended up just resorting to W3 Schools after about 2 minutes and discovered it was `float` that should be used.  After getting the correct results for this WOD and watching the ScreenCast, I noticed a few things that Professor Johnson did differently than I did in the CSS.  The first thing that I did differently was setting the margins.  For my margin property, I used only two values to set all the margins to get the same results.  For example, I said `margin: 10px 50px;` instead of `margin: 10px 50px 10px 50px;`.  This is known as margin shorthand, where you can use two values to set all the margins with the first value being the top and bottom margins and the second value being the right and left margins.  This is a case where you can define properties in multiple ways in CSS and this why I sometimes get confused with even the most common properties.  One new thing that I learned after watching the ScreenCast was using alternative fonts for text.  For example, Oswald is a sans serif font and just in case the page does not load the font, it would use a sans serif font instead.  This is just like using “alt text” in html just in case an image does not load on a web page and I noticed that having fallbacks is common practice for developing just about anything in any language.

**BrowserHistory3**

BrowserHistory3 was the most challenging of them all and it took me 2 tries to get into the advanced range.  Just like BrowserHistory2, what made this workout challenging was the CSS properties.  On my first try, I only knew how to do two things.  The first thing I knew what to do was creating a `<div class>` for each of the sections in the HTML so that I can set each section to appear side-by-side in columns.  The second thing I knew how to do was set the table of contents to appear inline and for everything else, I resorted to external resources.  One thing that always confused was the difference between margins and paddings because they both sort of work the same way, just for different things of the document.  Padding deals with the inside space of the border to create space around content and margins deal with space outside the border.  The ScreenCast definitely cleared things up for me on what each one is for and when to use them.

**BrowserHistory6**

Now that I have completed BrowserHistory6, this was definitely a step up from BrowserHistory3 because this WOD incorporated JavaScript.  This WOD involved changing the overall look of the web page by modifying a few CSS properties, but the main point of this exercise was to utilize JavaScript attributes by adding buttons to the top of the page with the links to different html documents.  A link to this WOD is [here](https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/040.dynamic-web-pages/experience-browserhistory6.html).

To prepare for this WOD, I did a quick review of the previous 3 WODs by reviewing the tasks, my code, and even my responses on this page to go over what I need to master before moving on to this WOD.  I wanted to make sure that covered the User Interface Basics so that I would not waste time trying to remember how to code simple concepts in HTML/CSS.

As for my experience with this WOD, everything worked well as I was going through this WOD.  What helped me was reading through the directions first so that I have a sense of what to expect and not get caught off guard by anything that seems unfamiliar.  In steps 1-6, I felt more confident than before thanks to the previous WODs, but I still made quick references here and there that hindered my performance a little.  One part that surprised me when I discovered that I actually got it correct was step 7, where we had to add on onclick event to the appropriate history page because that was the first time I’ve successfully done something like that without having to refer to an external source.  I’m also glad that Professor Port and Professor Kazman went over this as well during Lab 5.  However, when I got to step 8, I kept on getting errors in VS Code and didn’t know what was causing the problem.  I did not know what I was doing wrong for a while, but I noticed the hint at the bottom which made me realize that I was confusing the parser with having multiple double quotes instead of single quotes inside of double quotes.

In conclusion, these WODs in using an athletic approach to software development was a new experience for me and I very much enjoyed these assignments.  They tested me on what I needed to know at my current level of programming, allowed to feel what it was like to work with time constraints, and tested my overall efficiency/accuracy to set up a basic webpage.  One thing that I find useful if you are new to programming or are intimidated by this assignment is to read through the directions first before starting the timer so that you know what is required and not come across anything unexpected.  It’s okay if you get stumped on some tasks because there are a multitude of resources out there and you can redo these as many times as you want.  If you know nothing at all, I would not suggest going straight to the screencast because you’ll just end up copying the answers.  Once you see the answers, you can’t “unsee” them and you won’t learn that much by copying.  I suggest going to popular websites for programming such as MDN, W3, StackOverFlow, and more.  You should also know that even if you know how to do the tasks one way, there might be an easier or more efficient way to do it and there will never be a point where you know “everything” about a programming language.  Coding is a lifelong learning process and you will learn something new if you practice every day.
