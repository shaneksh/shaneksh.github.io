My name is Shane Shimizu and I am currently a Junior in the Shidler College of Business majoring in Management Information Systems at the University of Hawaii Manoa.

I decided to major in Management Information Systems because I enjoy learning about Information Technology and many of the new technologies being used in the world today, especially in the business environment. Some of my interests include Data Analytics, Cybersecurity, Cloud Computing, and Networking.  

As for work experience, I am currently an Accounts Payable Clerk at the University of Hawaii Campus Services.  My job duties include processing invoices and service billings, printing, scanning, reconciling, and filing various documents.
