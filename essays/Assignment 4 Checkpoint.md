# Describe the web-application you intend to build (in detail please!)

For our web application, we are creating a possible web-site for Kiara’s job. Her cousin currently owns a small Acai bowl stand in Kailua and could use a website to help expand his business. The website will take pre-orders for their two types of bowls, as well as sell his merchandise. The business owner currently has t-shirts and stickers for sale at the stand, but thinks that selling it on a website can bring in more revenue. We will create a website that has different pages for each type of category (food, clothes, accessories), an “about us” page, contact us page, location page, and an invoice. The website user will also have an option to create or sign in to their account to receive sale notifications, as well as a fast checkout if they are signed in. 

# Indicate how you expect the application will make use of the required technical complexity items (e.g. file I/O, sessions, multi-dimensional arrays, etc.)

Our website will use arrays, loops/conditions, and custom login features to display the products in the store. The user will be prompted to sign in or register when purchasing products, using the File I/O aspect. We will then incorporate the sessions/cookies to kick the user off if they have been inactive on the site for a minimum of 5 minutes. 

- Sessions/Cookies

User will have to re-login if they are inactive for 10 minutes

- File I/O

The user will have to login/register on the products page or log in/register after clicking purchase before viewing the invoice.  Regardless, the user must log in/register before completing the purchase of the products.

- Multi-dimensional arrays

User registration, displaying the products for sale

- Form processing and validation of entries/Loops/Conditionals

Entering product quantities, user login/registration

- CSS/HTML5

Site is professional, unique, and flows from page to page 

# What is your plan to ensure you successfully complete your project before the end of the semester?

Start early and finish early! We will constantly be working on the project and have a checklist that will show the progress we have made, as well as what we still have to complete. We will take things in stages and set goals to have aspects completed by a certain date so we don't have to cram right before the due date.

# What progress have you made so far and what is left for you to do?

We currently have finalized our idea of the webpage and will begin creating the web application. Since Kiara works for the business, she is familiar with the information that will be implemented on the site which will make the content easier to input.
