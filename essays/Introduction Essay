My name is Shane Shimizu and I am currently a Junior in the Shidler College of Business majoring in Management Information Systems at the University of Hawaii Manoa.

I decided to major in Management Information Systems because I really enjoy learning about Information Technology and many of the new technologies being used in the world today, especailly in the business environment.  Some of interests include Data Analytics, Cybersecurtiy, Cloud Computing, and Networking.
